// One weekend in March 2019 Kelly Link and Ursula Grant put together four zines. They are all saddle-stitched (i.e. stapled), with b&w covers and interiors and card color covers and were printed by the fine people of Paradise Copies. We also made sets of b&w postcards of Ursula’s illustrations for Kelly’s Horoscope Stories. We sold the chapbooks and gave away postcards at the AWP and Juniper book fairs (so many Pisces and Taurus!). We’ll have them at WisCon and the Brooklyn Book Fair and other fairs and festivals we go to and now we’re making them available here. The zines can be ordered individually or in bundles with or without the postcards. The postcards are being sold in sets of a dozen (mixed or you can choose a dozen of a singe sign) and we’ll have continue to have them as giveaways at book fairs, &c.

// Zines will be shipped by First Class Mail without tracking — unless Priority Mail is added — in the USA. (99% of orders arrive ok but if you order more than say a dozen zines, it may be worth it.) International shipping will be added by Paypal or by email once your order is placed.

// Tip: if you’d like multiple copies, select that here as selecting multiple copies on the PayPal page will not include the tiny discounts.
